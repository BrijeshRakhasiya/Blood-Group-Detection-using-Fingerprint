# Blood Group Detection using Fingerprint

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect a person's blood group using fingerprint analysis. By leveraging image processing techniques and machine learning models, we analyze the unique patterns in fingerprints to classify blood groups efficiently.

## 🚀 Features  
- Uses fingerprint images for blood group classification  
- Image preprocessing with OpenCV  
- Machine learning model for classification  
- User-friendly interface for easy input and results  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow/Keras (or any ML library used)  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Flask (if there's a web interface)
